## Developing

### Requirements

* [Apache Maven 3.3.3+](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
* [Java 8+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* Network access to https://repository.sonatype.org/content/groups/sonatype-public-grid

Also, there is a good amount of information available at [Bundle Development](https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3/Bundle+Development)

### Building

To build the project and generate the bundle use Maven

    mvn clean package

If everything checks out, the bundle for Composer should be available in the `target` folder

#### Build with Docker

`docker build -t nexus-repository-composer:0.0.2 .`

#### Run as a Docker container

`docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --name nexus nexus-repository-composer:0.0.2` 

For further information like how to persist volumes check out [the GitHub repo for our official image](https://github.com/sonatype/docker-nexus3).

The application will now be available from your browser at http://localhost:8081

## Using Composer With Nexus Repository Manager 3

[We have detailed instructions on how to get started here!](docs/COMPOSER_USER_DOCUMENTATION.md)

## Installing the plugin

There are a range of options for installing the Composer plugin. You'll need to build it first, and
then install the plugin with the options shown below:

### Temporary Install

Installations done via the Karaf console will be wiped out with every restart of Nexus Repository. This is a
good installation path if you are just testing or doing development on the plugin.

* Enable Nexus console: edit `<nexus_dir>/bin/nexus.vmoptions` and change `karaf.startLocalConsole`  to `true`.

  More details here: [Bundle Development](https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3/Bundle+Development+Overview)

* Run Nexus' console:
  ```
  # sudo su - nexus
  $ cd <nexus_dir>/bin
  $ ./nexus run
  > bundle:install file:///tmp/nexus-repository-composer-0.0.2.jar
  > bundle:list
  ```
  (look for org.sonatype.nexus.plugins:nexus-repository-composer ID, should be the last one)
  ```
  > bundle:start <org.sonatype.nexus.plugins:nexus-repository-composer ID>
  ```

### (more) Permanent Install

For more permanent installs of the nexus-repository-composer plugin, follow these instructions:

* Copy the bundle (nexus-repository-composer-0.0.2.jar) into <nexus_dir>/deploy

This will cause the plugin to be loaded with each restart of Nexus Repository. As well, this folder is monitored
by Nexus Repository and the plugin should load within 60 seconds of being copied there if Nexus Repository
is running. You will still need to start the bundle using the karaf commands mentioned in the temporary install.

### (most) Permanent Install

If you are trying to use the Composer plugin permanently, it likely makes more sense to do the following:

* Copy the bundle into `<nexus_dir>/system/org/sonatype/nexus/plugins/nexus-repository-composer/0.0.2/nexus-repository-composer-0.0.2.jar`
* Make the following additions marked with + to `<nexus_dir>/system/org/sonatype/nexus/assemblies/nexus-core-feature/3.x.y/nexus-core-feature-3.x.y-features.xml`

   ```
         <feature prerequisite="false" dependency="false">nexus-repository-rubygems</feature>
   +     <feature prerequisite="false" dependency="false">nexus-repository-composer</feature>
         <feature prerequisite="false" dependency="false">nexus-repository-gitlfs</feature>
     </feature>
   ```
   And
   ```
   + <feature name="nexus-repository-composer" description="org.sonatype.nexus.plugins:nexus-repository-composer" version="0.0.2">
   +     <details>org.sonatype.nexus.plugins:nexus-repository-composer</details>
   +     <bundle>mvn:org.sonatype.nexus.plugins/nexus-repository-composer/0.0.2</bundle>
   + </feature>
    </features>
   ```
This will cause the plugin to be loaded and started with each startup of Nexus Repository.

## The Fine Print

It is worth noting that this is **NOT SUPPORTED** by Sonatype, and is a contribution of ours
to the open source community (read: you!)

Remember:

* Use this contribution at the risk tolerance that you have
* Do NOT file Sonatype support tickets related to Composer support in regard to this plugin
* DO file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch in

Phew, that was easier than I thought. Last but not least of all:

Have fun creating and using this plugin and the Nexus platform, we are glad to have you here!

## Getting help

Looking to contribute to our code but need some help? There's a few ways to get information:

* Chat with us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/sonatype/nexus-developers)
* Check out the [Nexus3](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nexus3) tag on Stack Overflow
* Check out the [Nexus Repository User List](https://groups.google.com/a/glists.sonatype.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/nexus-users)

## Composer Plugin
The composer plugin `elendev/nexus-composer-push` (https://github.com/Elendev/nexus-composer-push) provide a composer command to push to a Nexus Repository using this plugin.
