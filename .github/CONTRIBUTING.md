## How to be a contributor to this project

### Are you submitting a pull request?

* Use [our codestyle](https://github.com/sonatype/codestyle). If we get a PR that doesn't match it, there will be
much shaming throughout the land. If you use an editor besides Eclipse or IntelliJ, adapt the codestyle and submit a PR
there :)
* Fill out a CLA for us, so we can sort out all the legal parts of contributing. You can get all the information for
this [here](https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3/Bundle+Development#BundleDevelopment-ContributingBundles). You may go, this is for your book, is it
applicable for this repo? Yes, absolutely. Follow the CLA process and email in your form. We are working on a way to
make this simpler, as well.
* Make sure to fill out an issue for your PR, so that we have traceability as to what you are trying to fix,
versus how you fixed it.
* Try to fix one thing per pull request! Many people work on this code, so the more focused your changes are, the less
of a headache other people will have when they merge their work in.
* Ensure your Pull Request passes tests either locally or via TravisCI (it will run automatically on your PR)
* Make sure to add yourself or your organization to CONTRIBUTORS.md as a part of your PR, if you are new to the project!
* If you're stuck, ask our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/sonatype/nexus-developers)! There are a number of
experienced programmers who are happy to help with learning and troubleshooting.
